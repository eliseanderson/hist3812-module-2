Raggedy Ann and Totoro Remix Paradata

Elise Anderson

Introduction:

This model is a remix of my Raggedy Ann model from the first module and a model of a Totoro plush. Although historians have a reputation for disliking the idea of remixing, the truth is historians remix every day. For example, every museum is a remix, with objects being presented in different contexts depending on the plaques, where it is located, any further explanation, the individual viewing it, and when the museum was visited. Much of history as we know it is not made up of facts as much as interpretation of evidence. In the case of my remix, it was made to be a sort of virtual museum object. The objects themselves are giving new meaning and gives the viewer a new way of thinking about the two toys, but the blank slate of the toys leave them open to the unique interpretation of the viewer.

Why has it been created and for what use?

Keeping with the idea that my remixed model is a virtual museum display, it's main purpose is appropriately to put Totoro and Raggedy Ann in a new context in which to reflect on their histories. By placing them together, the similarities and differences are highlighted. They are similar in which they are both toys made for childrens entertainment. Their blank texture highlights their similar purpose, but also proposes the open ended possibilities for each doll (particularly to the eyes of a child). They are both derived from another 20th century source, but Raggedy Ann is from an early 1900s book whereas Totoro is from a later 1900s film. Not only do their origins highlight the difference in time, but also in culture, with Raggedy Ann being American and Totoro Japanese. Still, they retain commonality being mass produced toys even made of similar materials. In summary, the fact of being a toy is the same, their origins are similar, and the story of the individual doll is totally unique.












Approach and methods/steps

For this project I used Meshmixer. I started by importing my own Raggedy Ann model from module 1. I then went to Sketchfab dot com for other models to mix it with. Once I had decided to use the Totoro model, I imported/appended it to the same project as my Raggedy Ann doll. I then used the transform tool to manipulate the positions of each model. Once I was happy with this, I combined the two models to be one model and exported the result in .stl format. The final result was then uploaded to sketchfab dot com.







Uncertainty and Alternate Interpretation

The biggest cause for uncertainty is the lack of color and texture on the dolls themselves. This anonymity is meant to illustrate the open ended interpretation of toys to children and adults alike, but could also be interpreted for a statuesque presence. They also might not be identified as toys at all, particularly by viewers unfamiliar with either doll. Finally, the fact that it was meant to give each viewer their own unique way of thinking about it means there will likely be many different meanings and associations made to them. At the end of the day, I think opening new ways of thinking is what remixes are for.
